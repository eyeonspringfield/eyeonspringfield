## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I am Mark Csorgo, a Computer Science student at the University of Szeged and currently a Software Engineer Intern at Morgan Stanley.

Outside of university and my internship, I enjoy building hobby projects that I find both fun and practically useful.

### Tech Stack & Interests
- **Languages:** C++, C#, Python, Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, TypeScript, R, x86 Assembly
- **Areas of Interest:**
  - Low-level programming and assembly
  - Quantitative finance and financial modeling
  - Experimental and niche software design
  - Free and open-source software (FOSS)

### Featured Projects:
- **[avallama](https://github.com/4foureyes/avallama)**
  - A multi-platform GUI for Ollama using the Avalonia framework.
  - Technologies: C#, Avalonia UI
  - Available under the [4foureyes](https://github.com/4foureyes) organization
- **[Î¼vc](https://github.com/eyeonspringfield/muvc)**
  - An experimental version control system designed for musicians and audio workflows.
  - Technologies: C++
- **Profiler Tool**
  - A C++ tool for profiling the latency of an arbitrary callable using `chrono` and hand-written assembly for benchmarking.
  - Technologies: C++, x86_64 Assembly, R
  - *Coming soon...*

### Just for fun:
- A sorting algorithm runtime estimator written in Python (because benchmarking random inputs is more fun than sorting them).
