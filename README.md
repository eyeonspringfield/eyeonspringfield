## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I am Mark Csorgo, a Computer Science student at the University of Szeged and currently a Software Engineer Intern at Morgan Stanley.

Beyond my university work and internship responsibilities, I enjoy building hobby projects that I find cool and genuinely useful. Below is a list of projects I'd like to showcase.

### Featured Projects:
- **[avallama](https://github.com/4foureyes/avallama)**
  - A multi-platform GUI for Ollama using the Avalonia framework.
  - Technologies: C#, Avalonia UI
  - Avaliable under the [4foureyes](https://github.com/4foureyes) organization
- **[Î¼vc](https://github.com/eyeonspringfield/muvc)**
  - An experimental version control system designed for musicians and audio workflows.
  - Technologies: C++
- **Profiler Tool**
  - A C++ tool for profiling the latency of an arbitrary callable using `chrono` and hand-written assembly for benchmarking.
  - Technologies: C++, x86_64 Assembly, R
  - *Coming soon...*
 
### Open source project contributions:
- **[catflower](https://github.com/bmartin042503/catflower)**, an open source 100% P2P based social network
  - Technologies: TypeScript, Rust, HTML, Vue.js
  - Created by Martin Bartos, and currently still in early stages of development, but I plan to contribute to the project as development continues.
 - **phpMyAdmin**: I contributed to the Hungarian translation of the software

### Just for fun:
- A sorting algorithm runtime estimator written in Python (because benchmarking random inputs is more fun than sorting them).
