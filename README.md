## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I am Mark Csorgo, a Computer Science student at the University of Szeged.

I host my personal and university projects on this GitHub account, aswell as some small joke/fun programs I have written. Some projects are currently being worked on, while others have been finished and have repositories for archival purposes.



### Projects I am currently working on:
- My github pages personal website
- Rfsocial, a Nodejs based social media web app (group project)

### Projects I have completed and are archived here:
- A PHP based used car market website (group project)
- A database management application using JavaFX and MariaDB
- A Pinterest type web application for university students, made using the Angular framework

### Fun / joke programs:
- "CsÃ¶rgÅ‘-fÃ©le cigifÃ¼ggvÃ©ny" (Csorgo's cigarette function); a console app that attempts to estimate the cost of the users smoking habits, written in C++
- A sorting algorithm runtime estimator written in Python
